MQTTany is designed to make it easy to connect hardware on single board computers to
your home automation solution. It is built around the concept of *modules*, each with a
specific purpose, so that only the components that are needed for your use case are
loaded. *Communication Modules* are responsible for connections to the outside, like
an MQTT broker, to allow publishing states and receiving commands. *Interface Modules*
provide access to hardware on or connected to the platform that MQTTany is running on.
